# PROJECT WITH PURPOSE TO USE SASS
======================================================

* #1 - To import files use @use 'file name'.

* #2 - https://cdnjs.com/libraries/font-awesome
To get the icons.

* #3 - The google fonts link puts it in the HTML!

* #4 - sass --watch sass/styles.sass:css/styles.css to have sass automatically compile the code to CSS.

* #5 - Using @next is useful when you need to access the next value in a list when dynamically processing styles with Sass.

* #6 - Example of creating variables = $primary-color: #FFF

* #7- mixins = several preset styles: You need to create the file "_mixins.sass" and inside it create for example "@mixin container" and below it the codes.
to include this mixin in style.sass, put "@include mixins.container" in the element you want.

!!! SPACES MATTER A LOT!!!
